Creating an HTML File
=====================

=> create a file name index.html
    - The reason behind this is if the file is named index.html and it's at your root directory of your folder.
      then your web browser will think that file as the homepage of your website.

<!DOCTYPE html> ... telling my webbrowser, the type of this document is html.

<html> ... starting tag (This is the highest level tag in our website)

    <head> .. head of document - the tags that define information about the HTML document

        <title>Rakka's Website</title> ... title tag - define the title of our website (before was index.html)

    </head>

    <body> ... body of document - where all of our HTML content is going to go

    </body>

</html> ... ending tag
