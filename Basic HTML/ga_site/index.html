            <h1>How to implement Object-Oriented Programming in Tkinter</h1>
            <article style="text-align:justify">
                As we know tkinter is a python built-in library with an easy learning-curve and development.

                Python itself support Object-Oriented Programming, an programming paradigm that assume that everything
                is an object. Python implement OOP with a built-in named "class".

                With "class", we can create our own data type. Take a look at this:
                <br/><br/>
                <p style="text-align:justify">
                    import tkinter as tk <br/>
                    class Application(tk.Tk): <br/><br/>
                    First, we import tkinter with aliases name "tk" for simplification. Many of you saw everyone using
                    star (*) import like "from tkinter import *".
