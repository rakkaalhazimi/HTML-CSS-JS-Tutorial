    // it at the end of the list of children, or insertBefore, which inserts the node
    // given as the first argument before the node given as the second argument.

    // The replaceChild method is used to replace a child node with another one.
    // It takes as arguments two nodes: a new node and the node to be replaced.

    // Note that both replaceChild and insertBefore expect the new node as their first
    // argument.
