  <!--
  The styling system for HTML is called CSS, for Cascading Style Sheets. A style
  sheet is a set of rules for how to style elements in a document.

  Styles in a style attribute applied directly to
  the node have the highest precedence and always win.

  The precedence rule favoring the most recently defined rule applies only
  when the rules have the same specificity.

  A ruleâ€™s specificity is a measure of
  how precisely it describes matching elements, determined by the number and
  kind (tag, class, or ID) of element aspects it requires. For example, a rule that
  targets p.a is more specific than rules that target p or just .a and would thus
  take precedence over them.

  <p id="main" class="a b">This is "p" tag with id "main" and from class "a" and "b".</p>
