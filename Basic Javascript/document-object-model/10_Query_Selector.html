  <!--
  The querySelectorAll method, which is defined both on the document object
  and on element nodes, takes a selector string and returns a NodeList containing
  all the elements that it matches.
  -->

  <script>
    function count(selector) {
      return document.querySelectorAll(selector).length;
    }
    console.log(count("p"));                    // All <p> elements
    // 4
    console.log(count(".animal"));              // Class animal
    // 2
    console.log(count("p.animal"));             // animal inside of <p>
    // 2
    console.log(count("p > .animal"));          // Direct child of <p>
    // 1
  </script>

  <!--
  Unlike methods such as getElementsByTagName, the object returned by querySelectorAll
  is not live. It wonâ€™t change when you change the document. It is still not a
  real array, though, so you still need to call Array.from if you want to treat it
  like one.

  The querySelector method (without the All part) works in a similar way.
  This one is useful if you want a specific, single element. It will return only the
  first matching element or null when no element matches.
