  <!--
  The position style property influences layout in a powerful way.

  By default
  it has a value of static, meaning the element sits in its normal place in the
  document.

  When it is set to relative, the element still takes up space in the
  document, but now the top and left style properties can be used to move it
  relative to that normal place.

  When position is set to absolute, the element is
  removed from the normal document flow—that is, it no longer takes up space
  and may overlap with other elements.

  Also, its top and left properties can
  be used to absolutely position it relative to the top-left corner of the nearest
  enclosing element whose position property isn’t static, or relative to the
  document if no such enclosing element exists.

  We can use this to create an animation. The following document displays a
  picture of a cat that moves around in an ellipse:
  -->

  <p style="text-align: center">
    <img src="cute cat.png" style="position: relative" width="20%" height="20%">
  </p>

  <script>
    let cat = document.querySelector("img");
    let angle = 2 * Math.PI;
    function animate(time, lastTime) {
      if (lastTime != null) {
        angle += (time - lastTime) * 0.001;
      }
      cat.style.top = (Math.sin(angle) * 200) + "px";
      cat.style.left = (Math.cos(angle) * 200) + "px";
      requestAnimationFrame(newTime => animate(newTime, time));
    }
    requestAnimationFrame(animate);
  </script>
  <!--
  The script uses requestAnimationFrame to schedule the animate function to
  run whenever the browser is ready to repaint the screen. The animate function
  itself again calls requestAnimationFrame to schedule the next update. When
  the browser window (or tab) is active, this will cause updates to happen at a
  rate of about 60 per second, which tends to produce a good-looking animation.

  Math.cos and Math.sin are useful for finding points that lie on a circle around
  point (0,0) with a radius of one.

  Math.cos tells you the x-coordinate of the point that corresponds to
  the given position, and Math.sin yields the y-coordinate.

  This unit for measuring angles is called radians—a full circle is 2phi radians,
  similar to how it is 360 degrees when measuring in degrees. The constant phi is
  available as Math.PI in JavaScript.
