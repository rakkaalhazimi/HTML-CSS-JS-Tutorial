  <!--
  A better mechanism to find out whether a key on keyboard is being pressed
  is for the system to actively notify our code when an
  event occurs. Browsers do this by allowing us to register functions as handlers
  for specific events.
  -->

  <p>Click this document to activate the handler</p>
  <script>
    window.addEventListener("click", () => alert("knocked"));
  </script>

  <!--
  The window binding refers to a built-in object provided by the browser.
  It represents the browser window that contains the document. Calling its
  addEventListener method registers the second argument to be called whenever
  the event described by its first argument occurs.
