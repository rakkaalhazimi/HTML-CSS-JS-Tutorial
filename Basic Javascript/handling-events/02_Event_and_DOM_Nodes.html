  <!--
  Event listeners are called only when the event happens
  in the context of the object they are registered on.
  -->

  <button>Click me</button>
  <p>No hanlder here.</p>
  <script>
    let sample = "up"
    let button = document.querySelector("button");
    button.addEventListener("click", () => alert("Button is clicked"));
  </script>

  <!--
  That example attaches a handler to the button node. Clicks on the button
  cause that handler to run, but clicks on the rest of the document do not.

  Giving a node an onclick attribute has a similar effect. This works for most
  types of events—you can attach a handler through the attribute whose name
  is the event name with "on" in front of it.

  But a node can have only one onclick attribute, so you can register only
  one handler per node that way. The addEventListener method allows you to
  add any number of handlers so that it is safe to add handlers even if there is
  already another handler on the element.

  <!--
  The removeEventListener method, called with arguments similar to addEventListener
  , removes a handler.
  -->

  <button class="btn1">Act-once button</button>
  <script>
    let button1 = document.querySelector(".btn1")
    function once() {
      alert("Done");
      button1.removeEventListener("click", once);
    }
    button1.addEventListener("click", once);
  </script>

  <!--
  The function given to removeEventListener has to be the same function value
  that was given to addEventListener. So, to unregister a handler, you’ll want
  to give the function a name (once, in the example) to be able to pass the same
  function value to both methods.
