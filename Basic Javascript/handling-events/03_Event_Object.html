  <!--
  event handler functions are passed an argument:
  the event object. This object holds additional information about the
  event. For example, if we want to know which mouse button was pressed, we
  can look at the event object’s button property.
  -->

  <button>Click me any way you want</button>
  <script>
    let button = document.querySelector("button");
    button.addEventListener("mousedown", event => {
      if (event.button == 0) {
        console.log("Left Button");
      } else if (event.button == 1) {
        console.log("Middle Button");
      } else if (event.button == 2) {
        console.log("Right Button");
      }
    });
  </script>

  <!--
  The information stored in an event object differs per type of event. We’ll
  discuss different types later in the chapter. The object’s type property always
  holds a string identifying the event (such as "click" or "mousedown").
