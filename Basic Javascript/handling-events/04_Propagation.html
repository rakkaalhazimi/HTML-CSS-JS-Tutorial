  For most event types, handlers registered on nodes with children will also receive
  events that happen in the children.

  But if both the paragraph and the button have a handler, the more specific
  handler—the one on the button—gets to go first.

  The event is said to propagate
  outward, from the node where it happened to that node’s parent node and on
  to the root of the document.

  Finally, after all handlers registered on a specific
  node have had their turn, handlers registered on the whole window get a chance
  to respond to the event.

  At any point, an event handler can call the stopPropagation method on the
  event object to prevent handlers further up from receiving the event.

  This can
  be useful when, for example, you have a button inside another clickable element
  and you don’t want clicks on the button to activate the outer element’s click
  behavior.

  The following example registers "mousedown" handlers on both a button and
  the paragraph around it. When clicked with the right mouse button, the handler
  for the button calls stopPropagation.
  -->

  <p>A paragraph with a <button>button</button></p>
  <script>
    let para = document.querySelector("p");
    let button = document.querySelector("button");
    para.addEventListener("mousedown", () => {
      console.log("Hanlder for paragraph");
    });
    button.addEventListener("mousedown", event => {
      console.log("Handler for button.");
      if (event.button == 2) event.stopPropagation();
    });
  </script>

  <!--
  Most event objects have a target property that refers to the node where they
  originated.

  You can use this property to ensure that you’re not accidentally
  handling something that propagated up from a node you do not want to handle.

  If you have a node containing a long list of buttons,
  it may be more convenient to register a single click handler on the outer node
  and have it use the target property to figure out whether a button was clicked,
  rather than register individual handlers on all of the buttons.

  <button>A</button>
  <button>B</button>
  <button>C</button>
  <script>
    document.body.addEventListener("click", event => {
      if (event.target.nodeName == "BUTTON") {
        console.log("Clicked", event.target.textContent);
      }
    });
  </script>
