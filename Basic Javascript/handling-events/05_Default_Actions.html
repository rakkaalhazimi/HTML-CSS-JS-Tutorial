  Many events have a default action associated with them. If you click a link,
  you will be taken to the link’s target. If you press the down arrow, the browser
  will scroll the page down. If you right-click, you’ll get a context menu. And so
  on.

  For most types of events, the JavaScript event handlers are called before the
  default behavior takes place. If the handler doesn’t want this normal behavior
  to happen, typically because it has already taken care of handling the event, it
  can call the preventDefault method on the event object.

  This can be used to implement your own keyboard shortcuts or context
  menu. It can also be used to obnoxiously interfere with the behavior that users
  expect. For example, here is a link that cannot be followed:
  -->

  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/">MDN</a>
  <script>
    let link = document.querySelector("a");
    link.addEventListener("click", event => {
      console.log("Nope.");
      event.preventDefault();
    });
  </script>

  <!--
  Try not to do such things unless you have a really good reason to. It’ll be
  unpleasant for people who use your page when expected behavior is broken.

  Depending on the browser, some events can’t be intercepted at all. On
  Chrome, for example, the keyboard shortcut to close the current tab (control-
  W or command-W) cannot be handled by JavaScript.
