  <!--
  When a key on the keyboard is pressed, your browser fires a "keydown" event.
  When it is released, you get a "keyup" event.
  -->

  <p>This page turn violet when you told the V key.</p>
  <script>
    let rndNumber = () => Math.random() * 129;
    window.addEventListener("keydown", event => {
      if (event.key == "v") {
        document.body.style.background = `rgb(${rndNumber()}, ${rndNumber()}, ${rndNumber()})`;
      }
    });
    window.addEventListener("keyup", event => {
      document.body.style.background = "";
    });
  </script>

  <!--
  Despite its name, "keydown" fires not only when the key is physically pushed
  down. When a key is pressed and held, the event fires again every time the
  key repeats. Pleaes be careful about this.

  The example looked at the key property of the event object to see which
  key the event is about. This property holds a string that, for most keys,
  corresponds to the thing that pressing that key would type.

  example: ENTERS would hold "Enter" string.

  If you hold shift while pressing a key, that might also influence the name of
  the keyâ€”"v" becomes "V", and "1" may become "!", if that is what pressing
  shift-1 produces on your keyboard.

  Modifier keys such as shift, control, alt, and meta (command on Mac)
  generate key events just like normal keys.

  But when looking for key combinations,
  you can also find out whether these keys are held down by looking at
  the shiftKey, ctrlKey, altKey, and metaKey properties of keyboard and mouse
  events.

  <p>Press control-space to continue</p>
  <script>
    window.addEventListener("keydown", event => {
      if (event.key == " " && event.ctrlKey) {
        console.log("Continuing !");
      }
    });
  </script>

  <!--
  The DOM node where a key event originates depends on the element that
  has focus when the key is pressed. Most nodes cannot have focus unless you
  give them a tabindex attribute, but things like links, buttons, and form fields
  can.

  When nothing in particular
  has focus, document.body acts as the target node of key events.

  When the user is typing text, using key events to figure out what is being
  typed is problematic.

  To notice when something was typed, elements that you can type into, such
  as the <input> and <textarea> tags, fire "input" events whenever the user
  changes their content. To get the actual content that was typed, it is best to
  directly read it from the focused field.
