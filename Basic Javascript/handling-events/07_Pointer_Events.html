  Mouse clicks
  ============
  Pressing a mouse button causes a number of events to fire. The "mousedown"
  and "mouseup" events are similar to "keydown" and "keyup" and fire when the
  button is pressed and released.

  After the "mouseup" event, a "click" event fires on the most specific node
  that contained both the press and the release of the button.

  For example, if I
  press down the mouse button on one paragraph and then move the pointer to
  another paragraph and release the button, the "click" event will happen on
  the element that contains both those paragraphs.

  If two clicks happen close together, a "dblclick" (double-click) event also
  fires, after the second click event.

  To get precise information about the place where a mouse event happened,
  you can look at its clientX and clientY properties, which contain the event’s
  coordinates (in pixels) relative to the top-left corner of the window,

  or pageX and pageY,
  which are relative to the top-left corner of the whole document
  (which may be different when the window has been scrolled).

  The following implements a primitive drawing program. Every time you click
  the document, it adds a dot under your mouse pointer.
  -->

  <section class="section-1"></section>
  <script>
    window.addEventListener("click", event => {
      if (event.target.className == "section-1") {
        let dot = document.createElement("div");
        dot.className = "dot";
        dot.style.left = (event.pageX - 4) + "px";
        dot.style.top = (event.pageY - 4) + "px";
        document.body.appendChild(dot);
      }
    });
  </script>

  <!--
  Mouse Motion
  ============
  Every time the mouse pointer moves, a "mousemove" event is fired. This event
  can be used to track the position of the mouse.

  A common situation in which
  this is useful is when implementing some form of mouse-dragging functionality.

  As an example, the following program displays a bar and sets up event handlers
  so that dragging to the left or right on this bar makes it narrower or
  wider:
  -->
  <section class="section-2">
    <p>Drag the bar to change its width:</p>
    <div style="background: orange; width: 60px; height:20px;"></div>
  </section>

  <script>
    let lastX; // Tracks the last observed mouse X position
    let bar = document.querySelector("div");
    bar.addEventListener("mousedown", event => {
      if (event.button == 0) {
        lastX = event.clientX;
        window.addEventListener("mousemove", moved);
        event.preventDefault(); // Prevent selection
      }
    });

    function moved(event) {
      if (event.buttons == 0) { // I think zero mean mouseup, maybe?
        window.removeEventListener("mousemove", moved);
      } else {
        let dist = event.clientX - lastX;
        let newWidth = Math.max(10, bar.offsetWidth + dist);
        bar.style.width = newWidth + "px";
        lastX = event.clientX;
      }
    };
  </script>

  <!--
  Note that the "mousemove" handler is registered on the whole window. Even
  if the mouse goes outside of the bar during resizing, as long as the button is
  held we still want to update its size.

  We must stop resizing the bar when the mouse button is released. For that,
  we can use the buttons property (note the plural), which tells us about the
  buttons that are currently held down. When this is zero, no buttons are down.

  When buttons are held, its value is the sum of the codes for those buttons—the
  left button has code 1, the right button 2, and the middle one 4. With the left
  and right buttons held, for example, the value of buttons will be 3.

  Note that the order of these codes is different from the one used by button,
  where the middle button came before the right one. As mentioned, consistency
  isn’t really a strong point of the browser’s programming interface.

  Touch Events
  ============
  To make the Web “work” on early touchscreen phones, browsers for those devices pretended,
  to a certain extent, that touch events were mouse events.
  If you tap your screen, you’ll get "mousedown", "mouseup", and "click" events.

  A touchscreen works differently from a
  mouse: it doesn’t have multiple buttons, you can’t track the finger when it
  isn’t on the screen (to simulate "mousemove"), and it allows multiple fingers to
  be on the screen at the same time.

  There are specific event types fired by touch interaction. When a finger starts
  touching the screen, you get a "touchstart" event. When it is moved while
  touching, "touchmove" events fire. Finally, when it stops touching the screen,
  you’ll see a "touchend" event.

  Because many touchscreens can detect multiple fingers at the same time,
  these events don’t have a single set of coordinates associated with them. Rather,
  their event objects have a touches property, which holds an array-like object of
  points, each of which has its own clientX, clientY, pageX, and pageY properties.

  You could do something like this to show red circles around every touching
  finger:
  -->

  <section class="section-3">
    <p>Touch this page</p>
  </section>

  <script>
    function update(event) {
      for (let dot; dot = document.querySelector("dot");) {
        dot.remove();
      }
      for (let i = 0; i < event.touches.length; i++) {
        let {pageX, pageY} = event.touches[i];
        let dot = document.createElement("dot");
        dot.style.left = (pageX - 50) + "px";
        dot.style.top = (pageY - 50) + "px";
        document.body.appendChild(dot);
      }
    }
    window.addEventListener("touchstart", update);
    window.addEventListener("touchmove", update);
    window.addEventListener("touchend", update);
  </script>
