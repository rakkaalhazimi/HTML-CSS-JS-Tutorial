  <!--
  When an element gains focus, the browser fires a "focus" event on it. When
  it loses focus, the element gets a "blur" event.

  Unlike the events discussed earlier, these two events do not propagate. A
  handler on a parent element is not notified when a child element gains or loses
  focus.

  The following example displays help text for the text field that currently has
  focus:
  -->

  <p>Name: <input type="text" data-help="Your full name"></p>
  <p>Age: <input type="text" data-help="Your age in years"></p>
  <p id="help"></p>

  <script>
    let help = document.querySelector("#help");
    let fields = document.querySelectorAll("input");
    for (let field of Array.from(fields)) {
      field.addEventListener("focus", event => {
        let text = event.target.getAttribute("data-help");
        help.textContent = text;
      });
      field.addEventListener("blur", event => {
        help.textContent = "";
      });
    }
  </script>

  <!--
  The window object will receive "focus" and "blur" events when the user
  moves from or to the browser tab or window in which the document is shown.
