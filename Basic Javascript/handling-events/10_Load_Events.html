    When a page finishes loading, the "load" event fires on the window and the
    document body objects. This is often used to schedule initialization actions that
    require the whole document to have been built.

    Remember that the content of
    <script> tags is run immediately when the tag is encountered. This may be
    too soon, for example when the script needs to do something with parts of the
    document that appear after the <script> tag.

    Elements such as images and script tags that load an external file also have
    a "load" event that indicates the files they reference were loaded. Like the
    focus-related events, loading events do not propagate.

    When a page is closed or navigated away from (for example, by following a
    link), a "beforeunload" event fires. The main use of this event is to prevent the
    user from accidentally losing work by closing a document.

    If you prevent the default behavior on this event and set the
    returnValue property on the event object to a string, the browser will show
    the user a dialog asking if they really want to leave the page.

    That dialog might include your string, but because some malicious sites try
    to use these dialogs to confuse people into staying on their page to
    look at dodgy weight loss ads, most browsers no longer display them.

  <script>
    function exitAlert(event) {
      event.preventDefault();
      event.returnValue = "Hello";
    }

    window.addEventListener("beforeunload", exitAlert);
  </script>
