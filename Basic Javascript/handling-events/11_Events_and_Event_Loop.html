  <!--
  Browser event handlers scheduled when the event occurs but must wait
  for other scripts that are running to finish before they get a chance to run.

  So if you schedule too much work, either with long-running event
  handlers or with lots of short-running ones, the page will become slow and
  cumbersome to use.

  * For cases where you really do want to do some time-consuming thing in the
    background without freezing the page, browsers provide something called web
    workers.

  * A worker is a JavaScript process that runs alongside the main script,
    on its own timeline.

  Imagine that squaring a number is a heavy, long-running computation that
  we want to perform in a separate thread.

  We could write a file called squareworker.js that responds to messages by
  computing a square and sending a message back.

  To avoid the problems of having multiple threads touching the same data,
  workers do not share their global scope or any other data with the main script’s
  environment.

  Instead, you have to communicate with them by sending messages back and forth.

  This code spawns a worker running that script, sends it a few messages, and
  outputs the responses.
  -->

  <script>
    let squareWorker = new Worker("squareWorker.js");
    squareWorker.addEventListener("message", event => {
      console.log("The worker responded: ", event.data);
    });
    squareWorker.postMessage(10);
    squareWorker.postMessage(20);
  </script>

  <!--
  * The postMessage function sends a message, which will cause a "message"
    event to fire in the receiver.

  Only values that can be represented as JSON can be sent as messages—the other
  side will receive a copy of them, rather than the value itself.
