  * We saw the setTimeout function in Chapter 11. It schedules another function
    to be called later, after a given number of milliseconds.

  Sometimes you need to cancel a function you have scheduled. This is done
  by storing the value returned by setTimeout and calling clearTimeout on it.
  -->

  <script>
    let bombTimer = setTimeout( () => console.log("BOM"), 500 );


    if (Math.random() < 0.5) {
      console.log("Defused.");
      clearTimeout(bombTimer);
    }
  </script>

  <!--
  * The cancelAnimationFrame function works in the same way as clearTimeout
    calling it on a value returned by requestAnimationFrame will cancel that
    frame (assuming it hasnâ€™t already been called).

  A similar set of functions, setInterval and clearInterval, are used to set
  timers that should repeat every X milliseconds.
  -->

  <script>
    let ticks = 0;
    let clock = setInterval( () => {
      console.log("tick", ticks++);
      if (ticks == 10) {
        clearInterval(clock);
        console.log("stop.");
      }
    }, 200);
  </script>
