  <!--
  * Some types of events have the potential to fire rapidly, many times in a row (the
   "mousemove" and "scroll" events, for example).

  * When handling such events, you must be careful not to do anything
    too time-consuming or your handler will take up so much time that
    interaction with the document starts to feel slow.

  If you do need to do something nontrivial in such a handler, you can use
  setTimeout to make sure you are not doing it too often.

  This is usually called debouncing the event. There are several slightly
  different approaches to this.

  In the first example, we want to react when the user has typed something, but
  we don’t want to do it immediately for every input event.

  When they are typing quickly, we just want to wait until a pause occurs.

  Instead of immediately performing an action in the event handler, we set a timeout.

  * We also clear the previous timeout (if any) so that when events occur close together
    (closer than our timeout delay), the timeout from the previous event will be canceled.

  <textarea>Type something here...</textarea>
  <script>
    let textarea = document.querySelector("textarea");
    let timeout;
    textarea.addEventListener("input", () => {
      clearTimeout(timeout);
      timeout = setTimeout( () => console.log("Typed!"), 500 );
    });
  </script>

  <!--
  Giving an undefined value to clearTimeout or calling it on a timeout that
  has already fired has no effect. Thus, we don’t have to be careful about when
  to call it, and we simply do so for every event.
  -->

  <!--
  We can use a slightly different pattern if we want to space responses so that
  they’re separated by at least a certain length of time but want to fire them
  during a series of events, not just afterward.

  For example, we might want to respond to "mousemove" events by showing
  the current coordinates of the mouse but only every 250 milliseconds.
